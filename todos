downloadZaneLoweAndGeneratePodcastFeed
===========================================
- Only copy feed to server if it's a valid rss feed
- Need to prevent the hard drive from getting filled up with shows
- Use online test to view what feed looks like to a consumer

podcastFeedGenerator
===========================================
- Need to research whether I should be calculating mime types by the extension and not by querying the file...little bit dodgy
- Add album artwork to each podcast item
